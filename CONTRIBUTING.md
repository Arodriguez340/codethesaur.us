# How to Contribute to Code Thesaurus

Hello! I'm glad you're reading this because I ([geekygirlsarah](https://twitter.com/geekygirlsarah)) can use more help with getting Code Thesaurus to become a working and usable site!

## Getting Started

Head over to http://codethesaur.us (production) or http://develop.codethesaur.us (developer changes) to see how the site works. 

You can also head over to the site [Wiki](https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us/wiki) and read about how the site is designed and developed and how the core thesaurus files are created.

## Code Changes

Presently all code is being written in the `develop` branch until the basic site is fully going, then will be merged into master/main.

## Reporting Bugs or Issues

Did you find a bug? Great! Make sure it's not already reported on our [Issues Page](https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us/issues)  page. If it's not, please open up a [New Issue](https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us/issues/new/choose) and add it so I can look it over.

## Fixing Bugs or Issues

Think you can tackle an issue? Great! Fork the repo so you have a copy of it, then make your changes. If you can test the changes and they work, then add a new pull request. I'll review it and leave any comments for things that may need to change.

Note: Due to the prolific spam at this year's Hacktoberfest, your PR may get marked as invalid or spam if it appears to not follow the request on the issue or appears to just be trying to get easy PRs for the shirt. If it's marked as invalid/spam as a mistake, please reach out so I can correct it.

## Adding New Features

I have a large roadmap for this and will be adding lots of new features in the near future. For now, the present focus is on getting our MVP (minimal viable product) out the door. For now, please stick with the Issues currently there and I will add new feature-issues when they're ready.

## Adding or Revising Documentation

I want Code Thesaurus to be easy-to-use for anyone regardless of their experience label. That requires good documentation of many facets of the project. I will very much welcome any additional changes or suggestions on what to change or how to evolve the documentation so it's helpful for people to understand the technical side of the site.

## What About Cosmetic Patches?

Issues marked with a `frontend` tag are open to having the cosmetic changes fixed. If there are typos or other issues, you are welcome to try to correct those. However, frivolous PRs for unnecessary changes may be marked as invalid or spam.

## Have Questions?

Please feel free to reach out! You can:

* Tweet [@codethesaurus](https://twitter.com/codethesaurus) or [@geekygirlsarah](https://twitter.com/geekygirlsarah)
* Email [coreteam@codethesaur.us](mailto:coreteam@codethesaur.us)
* Add comments onto issues if they are specific to that issue

## Happy Hacking!
